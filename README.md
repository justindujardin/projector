Visualizing Embeddings

This repository houses the code and data for visualizing various word embedding experiments using TensorBoard's projector.


### Visualizing "Learned Vector" for Attention

spaCy's text classifier uses a `ParametricAttention` layer that should learn an optimal query vector for
selecting the most appropriate tokens given an input. This experiment tries to understand what the query 
vector learns by observing the change in its vector over time in relation to the nearest neighbor tokens.
